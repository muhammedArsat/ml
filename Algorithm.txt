Lab1:
1.Initialize the hypothesis h to the most specific hypothesis in the hypothesis space. This is usually represented as a vector of "?" values, like [null, null, ..., null] or [ϕ, ϕ, ..., ϕ].

2.For each positive training example in the dataset:

3.If the hypothesis h is consistent with the training example, do nothing.
4.Otherwise, update the hypothesis h to the least general generalization that is consistent with the current example.
5.For each attribute of the hypothesis:
6.If the attribute value in h is the same as the value in the example, keep it unchanged.
7.If the attribute value in h is different, replace it with ? (i.e., the most general value).
8.Return the hypothesis h after processing all positive examples.


Lab2:

1.Load the image dataset of healthy and diseased plants.

2.Resize and preprocess the images for uniformity.

3.Extract features from the images (e.g., HOG, color histograms, CNN features).

4.Standardize the feature vectors to improve model performance.

5.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

6.Train the SVM classifier using the training set and selected kernel (e.g., linear, RBF).

7.Predict the labels for the test set using the trained SVM model.

8.Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

9.Use the model to classify new images as healthy or diseased.



Lab3:

1.Load the dataset containing medical records of patients.

2.Preprocess the data by normalizing or scaling the features.

3.Apply K-Means clustering with a predefined number of clusters (k).

4.Initialize K-Means centroids randomly and iteratively assign patients to the nearest centroid.

5.Update the centroids by averaging the data points in each cluster, and repeat until convergence.

6.Apply EM algorithm by initializing cluster means, variances, and mixing coefficients.

7.E-step of EM: Estimate the probability that each patient belongs to each cluster using the current parameters.

8.M-step of EM: Update the cluster parameters (mean, variance, mixing coefficients) based on the estimated probabilities.

9.Repeat E and M steps until the parameters converge.

10.Evaluate and compare clustering performance using metrics like silhouette score, purity, or adjusted Rand index.

11.Analyze clusters to interpret the results and identify personalized treatment plans for each cluster.

12.Visualize the clusters to compare the behavior of K-Means and EM on the medical data.
